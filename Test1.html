    <p>Tourism has long been the country's third-largest source of foreign currency. Due to the aftermath of the April 2019 Easter Terror Attacks, Sri Lanka registered over 1.9 million visitor visits in 2019, a 21% decrease from the previous year. In 2019, the industry is expected to generate roughly $3.5 billion. In the year 2020, around 570,000 visitors are expected to come. In 2020, the worldwide COVID-19 epidemic decimated the industry, which now caters nearly entirely to local visitors and foreign arrivals under severe "travel bubble" limitations. Beaches, animal parks, jungles, tea plantations, historical ruins, Buddhist cultural sites, and festivals are among the many attractions available in Sri Lanka. The World Economic Forum's Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Report 2019 ranks Sri Lanka 77th out of 141 nations.The UK, Germany, and France supplied the most tourist arrivals, followed by India and the People's Republic of China (PRC).</p>
    <p>The tourist sector had modest investment in 2020, with projects worth roughly $66 million being authorized. Sri Lanka's government wants to draw big personalities from around the world. Hilton, Marriott, Shangri-La, Six Senses, and Movenpick are among the worldwide and regional hotel groups that are developing or running hotels in Sri Lanka. Shangri-La and Movenpick opened in 2017, while DoubleTree by Hilton Weerawila Rajawarna Resort was taken over by Hilton in 2020. Others, such as Sheraton and ITC Hotels, are nearing completion of their projects. The majority of Sri Lanka's luxury resort hotels are controlled by a few local businesses.Furthermore, the boutique hotel idea is fast gaining popularity. International hotel corporations were missing from Sri Lanka throughout the long civil war (which concluded in 2009). For many years, Hilton had been the sole global operator in Sri Lanka, managing a luxury hotel (owned by the government) and an apartment complex in Colombo.</p>
    <p>Tourism provides chances for both investment and trade. For tourism development, the government is now offering beach property and islands. Because of the high quality of the beaches in this area, eastern Sri Lanka has a lot of promise. Pasekudah and Arugam Bay, in particular, are popular surfing sites. Several international environmental organizations consider the country to be a biodiversity hotspot because of its numerous parks and forests, which are home to a diverse range of animals and distinct flora species. Land sales to foreigners are prohibited, which might make the development of new homes more difficult. Eco-friendly resorts are also becoming more popular, with many developers deciding to build "green" hotels in order to appeal to a rising ecotourism market niche. Until the worldwide pandemic, increased tourism fueled tremendous expansion in the restaurant business.</p>
    <p>After shutting its airports to commercial traffic in March 2020, Sri Lanka reopened to international tourist arrivals in January 2021 under the "bio bubble" idea. For leisure tourists, the "Bio bubble" waives quarantine regulations, enabling them to leave the confines of their hotel rooms as long as they stay in authorized hotels and avoid mingling with locals. After a negative PCR test done on arrival, fully vaccinated travelers are able to escape the "bio bubble" and travel freely inside the nation, however execution of the program remained an issue as of September 2021.</p>
